# Path Coloring Library
 A C++ implementation in the [Boost Graph Library](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_64_0/libs/graph/doc/index.html) of two algorithms for path
 coloring and path list-coloring plane graphs.

## Directories:

### path_coloring
 This is the main directory of the project and contains header files for the
 three algorithms implemented. It also includes some headers for helper functions
 and data structures shared between the different algorithms. 

### visualization
 This directory contains a single header used to generate tikz drawings of
 boost graphs.

## Requirements
 The [Boost Libraries](http://www.boost.org/) and a compiler that supports the
 C++11 standard.
