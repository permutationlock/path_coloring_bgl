# Documents
 A C++ implementation in the [Boost Graph Library](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_64_0/libs/graph/doc/index.html) of two algorithms for path
 coloring and path list-coloring plane graphs.

## Directories:

### writeup
 This directory contains a formal writeup describing the background
 literature, as well as the correctness and
 complexity of each algorithm. It was completed to satisfy part
 of the requirements for my masters in computer science.

### slides
 This directory contains a set of slides used for my masters defense.

### tikz_figures
 This directory contains several drawings of plane graphs that were colored
 using the algorithms implemented.

## Requirements
 A [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) compiler and several standard
 packages. See the individual files for the specific packages required. The
 provided makefiles use [pdflatex](https://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/) by
 default; other compilers may be specified by changing the appropriate makefile
 variable.
