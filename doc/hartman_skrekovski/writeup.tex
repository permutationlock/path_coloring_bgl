\section*{Abstract}

Path coloring a graph partitions its vertices into sets inducing a disjoint union of paths. In this project
we consider several algorithms to compute path colorings of graphs embedded in the plane. We
first implement an algorithm to path 3-color plane graphs from Poh's proof in [a]. Second, we present a linear time
implementation of an algorithm to path 3-choose plane graphs from the independant work of Hartman [b] and
Skrekovski [c].

\section{Introduction}

All graphs discussed in this project will be simple, undirected, and finite. A graph is planar if it may
be drawn in the plane without edge crossings. A $k$-coloring of a graph partitions
its vertices into $k$ color classes. Such a coloring is called proper if each color class consists of
nonadjacent vertices.\\

\noindent Appel and Haken [d,e] display that all planar graphs have a proper $4$-coloring.
This result is best possible and is known as the Four Color Theorem.
Generalizations of proper coloring were introduced in [f,g,h] allowing color classes to form forests, or allowing vertices
to have some bounded number of same color neighbors. Cowen et al. ([j]) show a best possible result that planar
graphs may be $3$-colored such that each vertex recieves at most two same color neighbors.\\

\noindent We will be considering the problem of path coloring, producing a $k$-coloring of a graph such that each color
class induces a disjoint union of paths, or equivalently a forest where each component is a path. This coloring
was introduced by Harary in [i]. Note that this is similar to the defective coloring of Cowen et al. above,
with the added restriction that path coloring forbids cycles. In [l] Poh displayes that all
planar graphs have a path $3$-coloring. Here we present an implementation of Poh's algorithm to path
$3$-color plane graphs.\\

\noindent Given a list of $k$ colors for each vertex, a $k$-list-coloring, or $k$-choosing, assigns each vertex a
color from its list.
If a graph has a proper $k$-choosing it is said to be $k$-choosable. List-coloring was first introduced by
Erd{\"o}s et al. in [m]. Thomassen in [n] proves that all planar graphs are $5$-choosable. Planar
graphs that are not $4$-choosable are described by Mirzakhani in [o] and Voigt in [p], so Thomassen's result
is best possible. Jensen and Toft in [t] note that Thomassen's proof yields a linear algorithm for $5$-choosing
plane graphs.\\

\noindent Hull and Eaton in [q] prove planar graphs are $3$-choosable such that each vertex recieves at most two
same color neighbors, and furthermore show this result is best possible. Hartman in [r] and Skrekovski in [s] independantly
provide similar proofs that planar graphs are path $3$-choosable. Hartman claims the proof yields
a linear time algorithm for path $3$-list-coloring, and thus path $3$-coloring, plane graphs. Here we present a
linear time implementation of Hartman and Skrekovski's algorithm.

\section{Path $3$-Coloring Plane Graphs}

We first restate the theorem and proof of Poh [l]. This proof yields a simple algorithm for path $3$-coloring
plane graphs.\\

\begin{adjustwidth}{1.5em}{1.5em}
\noindent\textbf{Theorem 1.} Let $G$ be a $2$-connected weakly triangulated plane graph or a complete
graph on two vertices and
suppose the outer face $C$ has been $2$-colored such that each color class induces a non-empty path. This
$2$-coloring may be extended to a path $3$-coloring of $G$ such that no vertex in $V(C)$ recieves a same color
neighbor in $V(G)\setminus V(C)$.\\
\end{adjustwidth}

\begin{proof}
\noindent If $|V(G)|\le 3$ the coloring follows trivially. Let $|V(G)|>3$ and suppose the theorem holds
for all graphs $H$ with $|V(H)|<|V(G)|$. Let $P=p_0\ldots p_n$ and $Q=q_0\ldots q_m$ denote the two induced paths from the $2$-coloring of $C$
such that the edges $p_0q_0$ and $p_nq_m$ are in $C$. Suppose there exist uncolored vertices, that is
$V(G)\setminus V(C)\ne\emptyset$.\\

\noindent Let $t_0$ be the vertex forming a face with $p_0$ and $q_0$. If $t_0\in P$, this face is already
colored and we consider the graph bounded by $P-p_0$ and $Q$. Similarly, if $t_0\in Q$ then the inductive
hypothesis applies to the graph bounded by $P$ and $Q-q_0$. Let $t_1$ be the vertex forming a face with $p_n$
and $q_m$ and proceed in the same manner until $t_1$ is not in either path.\\

\noindent Suppose there exists an induced path $T$ from $t_0$ to $t_1$. We color $T$ the remaining color not
assigned to $P$ or $Q$ and apply the inductive hypothesis to the subgraph bounded by $P$ and $T$, and the
subgraph bounded by $T$ and $Q$. With only the path $T$ in common between the two subgraphs, the combined
$3$-coloring forms a path coloring of $G$.\\

\noindent Suppose no such path exists from $t_0$ to $t_1$. Since $G$ is weakly triangulated there must exist an
edge $p_iq_j\in E(G)\setminus E(C)$ with $p_i\in P$ and $q_j\in Q$. We separately apply the inductive hypothesis
to the subgraph bounded by $p_0\ldots p_i$ and $q_0\ldots q_j$, and the subgraph bounded by $p_i\ldots p_n$ and
$q_j\ldots q_m$. The two subgraphs only share the vertices $p_i$ and $q_j$, thus the combined $3$-coloring forms
a path coloring of $G$.\\
\end{proof}

\begin{adjustwidth}{1.5em}{1.5em}
\noindent\textbf{Corollary 2.} All plane graphs are path $3$-colorable.\\
\end{adjustwidth}

\begin{proof}
Let $G$ be a plane graph. Since adding edges does not make $G$ easier to color, augment $G$ with edges until
it is triangulated. Path $2$-color the outer triangle and apply Theorem 1 to path $3$-color $G$.\\
\end{proof}

\noindent Let $G$ be a weakly triangulated plane graph with outer face formed by the two monocolor paths $P$ and
$Q$, each colored sdistinct color. Poh's path $3$-coloring algorithm proceeds as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item If all vertices in $G$ are colored, terminate;
\item Locate the vertex $t_1$. If $t_1\in P$ remove $p_n$ and repeat. If $t_1\in Q$ remove $q_m$ and
repeat;

\subsection*{Implementing Poh's Algorithm}

Let the plane graph $G$ be represented as an incidence list (or adjacency list) and an ordering of edges (neighbors) around
each vertex following a
combinatorial embedding. We track the paths $P$ and $Q$ by marking each vertex with its respective path and
storing the path start and end vertices $p_0$, $p_n$, $q_0$, and $q_m$.
We first find $t_1$ by looking through the ordered neighbors of $q_m$ and take the vertex counterclockwise past
$p_n$. This step is repeated until the graph is colored or $t_1\not\in P\cup Q$.

\noindent We perform a
breadth first search starting at $t_1$ and storing parents for each vertex visited. Vertices marked to be in $P$
or $Q$ will be ignored, in this way containing the search within the current bounded subgraph. The
search terminates once a vertex $u$ with adjacent neighbors $p_i\in P$ and $q_j\in Q$ has been reached. An
induced $ut_1$-path is produced by backtracking through the search from $u$. We color and mark each vertex on the
new path with the remaining color not used to color $P$ or $Q$.\\

\noindent To color the remaining graph we recurse on both the region
bounded by the $p_ip_n$-path and $ut_1$-path, and the region bounded by the $ut_1$-path and $q_jp_m$-path.
If $p_i=p_0$ and $q_j=q_0$ we are done and this mimicks the case of a $t_0t_1$ path in with $u=t_0$.
If $p_i\ne p_0$ or $q_j\ne q_0$ we handle the remaining subgraph by recursing on the region bounded by the
$p_0p_i$-path and $q_0p_j$-path. Note each recursive step is independant and vertex marks are shared so the
algorithm may instead proceed iteratively by pushing paths, represented by their start and end
vertices, into a stack or queue.

\subsection*{Time Complexity}

\noindent Locating $t_1$ requires a single neighbor lookup. The amortized complexity of a neighbor lookup is
$O(|E|/|V|)$. Each vertex may be $t_1$ at most once so over the entire graph we perform at most $|V|$ neighbor
lookups. In planar graphs $|E|\le 3|V|-6$, and $O(|E|)=O(|V|)$. Therefore, the
amortized complexity of this step is $O(|V|^2/|V|)=O(|V|)$. We also perform at most one breadth first
search from each $t_1$ with complexity $O(|V|)$. Therefore the complexity of the serach step over the
entire graph is $O(|V|^2)$. This gives an overall amortized complexity of $O(|V|+|V|^2)=O(|V|^2)$.

\section{Path $3$-Choosing Plane Graphs}

The following is a restatment of a theorem of Hartman [r] and Skrekovski [s]. We provide a modification of
the proof that wraps the path coloring and path removal portions of Hartman's proof into a single inductive
step considering only the last vertex colored on the current path, which will be denoted $p$. This modification
is motivated by the relative simplicity of removing a single outer face vertex, compared with removing an entire
path. This proof yields a linear time algorithm and implementation, as claimed by Hartman in [r].\\

\noindent Suppose $C$ is
the outer cycle of a $2$-connected weakly triangulated plane graph $G$. Using notation from [r] for $u,v\in V(C)$
we let $C[u,v]$ denote the path from $u$ to $v$ clockwise along the outer face. If we wish to exclude $u$ or $v$
from this path we will use parenthesis, $C(u,v)$. Similarly, for $v\in V(G)$ and
$u,w\in N(v)$ we let $[u,w]_v$ denote the path from $u$ to $w$ clockwise around $v$, assuming triangulated
faces.\\

\noindent Note that in all figures solid circles denote vertices yet to be colored, and colored vertices will
be labeled with their assigned color. We have $\alpha$ denote the current path color and a label $\beta$ represent
coloring $v$ from $L(v)\setminus\{\alpha\}$. If a vertex $v$ is unlabled it represents arbitrary coloring from
$L(v)$.\\

\begin{adjustwidth}{1.5em}{1.5em}
\noindent\textbf{Theorem 3.} Let $G$ be a $2$-connected weakly triangulated plane graph, or a complete graph
on one or two vertics, with outer face $C$. 
Let $x,y\in V(C)$ be not necessarily distinct, potentially precolored vertices. Let $p\in C[x,y]$ be precolored some
color $\alpha$. Suppose $L(v)$ assigns a list of colors to each $v\in V(G)$ that has not been precolored such that
\[
    \begin{array}{ll}
	    |L(v)|\ge 1 & \text{if } v=x \text{ or } v=y;\\
	    |L(v)|\ge 2 & \text{if } v\in V(C)\setminus\{x,y\};\\
	    |L(v)|\ge 3 & \text{otherwise.}
    \end{array}
\]
If $p\ne x$, let $\alpha\not\in L(v)$ for
any $v\in V(C[x,p))$. Also assume the precoloring is a path coloring.\\

\noindent The coloring may be extended to
a path choosing of $G$ from $L$ such that $x$, $y$, and $p$ each recieve at most one same color neighbor. If
$x=y$ then $x$ and $y$ recieve no same color neighbors. If $y=p$, or $y$ is immediately prior to
$p$ on the outer face and $\alpha\not\in L(y)$, then $y$ recieves no same color neighbors.\\
\end{adjustwidth}

\begin{proof}
If $|V(G)\le 3$ the theorem easily follows. Suppose $|V(G)|>3$ and the theorem
holds for all graphs $H$ with $|V(H)|<|V(G)|$. Let
$C=c_0c_1\ldots c_n$ denote, in clockwise order, the outer face of $G$ with $p=c_0$.
There are several cases to consider. Let $c_i$ be the next vertex in $V(C)\cap N(p)$ counterclockwise from $c_n$.
Let $G_0$ be the subgraph bounded by the cycle formed from $C[c_i,c_n]$ and $[c_n,c_i]_p$. If $c_i\ne c_1$ let
$G_1$ be the sugbraph bounded by the cycle formed from $C[p,c_i]$ and the edge $pc_i$. As seen in Figure
3.1 $G=G_0\cup G_1$ and $V(G_0)\cap V(G_1)=\{c_i\}$.
We will display in each case that the inductive hypothesis holds for each subgraph and their union still
forms a path choosing of $G$ from $L$.
If $c_i=c_1$ we will say $G_1$ does not exist and handle this case specially, noting $G_0=G-p$.

\noindent For all $v\in (N(p)\cap V(G_0))\setminus\{x,y\}$ we note if $v=c_n$ or $v=c_i$
then $|L(v)|\ge 2$, and $|L(v)|\ge3$ otherwise. We define a new list assignment $L_0$
such that $L_0(v)=L(v)\setminus\{\alpha\}$ for
$v\in N(p)\cap V(G_0)$, and $L_0(v)=L(v)$ for $v\in V(G_0)\setminus N(p)$. Note that all
$v\in N(p)\cap V(G_0)$ will be on the outer face of $G_0$. Thus $|L_0(v)|\ge 3$ for all interior
vertices $v$ of $G_0$. Except for a few special cases for $y$ mentioned below, $|L_0(v)|\ge 1$ for all
$v\in\{x,y,c_i,c_n\}$. Finally, $|L_0(v)|\ge2$ for all other $v$ on the outer face of $G_0$. By choosing $G_0$ from
$L_0$ we ensure either $p$ recieves no $\alpha$ colored neighbors in $G_0$ unless $c_i$ is colored $\alpha$.
If $c_i$ is colored $\alpha$ then $p$ recieves no $\alpha$ colored neighbors in $G_1$ other than $c_i$.

\noindent If $\alpha\in L(y)$ and $y\in V(G_0)\cap N(p)$ it may be that $|L_0(y)|=0$. Note that in the case $y$
has been precolored a color distinct from $\alpha$ we will say $\alpha\not\in L(v)$. To handle this we
first note $y\in\{c_n, c_i\}$. The case $y=c_i$ will require no special treatment as $c_i$ will
naturally be colored $\alpha$. Suppose $\alpha\in L(y)$ and $y=c_n$. Then $x=p$, since otherwise $y\in C[x,p)$ and
$\alpha\not\in L(y)$. Color $y$ with $\alpha$ and apply the inductive hypothesis to choose
$G$ from $L$ with $x'=y$, $y'=x$, and $p'=y$. Otherwise suppose if $\alpha\in L(y)$ then $y\ne c_n$.

the first color in $L_0(c_n)$, note $|L_0(c_i)|\ge 2$ in this case. Apply the inductive hypothesis to
choose $G_0$ from $L_0$ with $x_0=c_n$, $y_0=y$, and $p_0$. If $G_1$ exists, apply the inductive
hypothesis to choose $G_1$ from $L$ with $x_1=p_1=p$ and $y_1=c_i$. Notice if $p_0=c_i$, $c_i$ recieves at most
one same color neighbor in $G_0$ and the single same color neighbor $p$ in $G_1$. Furthermore, $p$ will recieve no
same color neighbor in $G_1$ other than $c_i$. If $p_0\ne c_i$, then $y_1=c_i$ is immediatley prior to
$p_1=p$ and $\alpha\not\in L(c_i)$. Thus $c_i$ will recieve no same color neighbors in $G_1$.

\noindent Finally, suppose $x\ne p$, $y\ne p$, and $c_i\in C(p,y]$. If

$L_0(c_1)$, noting $|L_0(c_i)|\ge 2$ in this case. Apply the inductive hypothesis to
choose $G_0$ from $L_0$ with $x_0=x$, $y_0=y$, and $p_0$. If $G_1$ exists, apply the inductive again
hypothesis to choose $G_1$ from $L$ with $x_1=p_1=p$ and $y_1=c_i$. Note that $c_i$ was precolored by our
choosing of $G_0$. If $p_0=c_i$, $c_i$ recieves at most one same
color neighbor in $G_0$ and the single same color neighbor $p$ in $G_1$. Furthermore, $p$ will recieve no
same color neighbor in $G_1$ other than $c_i$. If $p_0\ne c_i$, then $y_1=c_i$ is immediatley prior to
$p_1=p$ and $\alpha\not\in L(c_i)$. Thus $c_i$ will recieve no same color neighbors in $G_1$.\\

\begin{adjustwidth}{1.5em}{1.5em}
\noindent\textbf{Corollary 4.} All planar graphs are path $3$-choosable.\\
\end{adjustwidth}

\begin{proof}
Let $G$ be a plane graph and $L$ an assignment of size $3$ color lists to each vertex of $G$. As adding edges does
not make $G$ easier to color, augment $G$ with edges until it is triangulated (maximally planar).
Assign $x$ and $y$ to be distinct vertices on the outer face. Color $x$ from $L(x)$
and assign $p=x$. Apply Theorem 3 to path choose $G$ from $L$ accordingly.\\
\end{proof}

\noindent Let $G$ be a weakly triangulated plane graph with vertices $x$, $y$, and $p$ defineds and possibly
precolored in accordance with Theorem 3. In the followin we will denote the outer face of $G$ as
$C=c_0c_1\ldots c_n$ with $c_0=p$.
We will denote the embedding ordered neighborhood $N(p)$ as $n_0\ldots n_k$, with $n_0=c_1$ and
$n_k=c_n$. We will denote the parameters for an application of the algorithm as the tuple $(G, x, y, p)$.
The path $3$-choosing algorithm proceeds as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item If $p$ has not been colored, color $p$ from $L(p)$;
\item If $n_k=y$ and $\alpha\in L(y)$, color $y$ with $\alpha$ and apply the algorithm to $G$ with $x'=p'=y$ and
$y'=p$;
\item Remove $\alpha$ from $L(n_k)$;
\item For $j=k-1$ to $0$: if $n_j\in C$ terminate, otherwise remove $\alpha$ from $L(n_j)$;
\item If $c_i\not\in C(p,y]$ remove $\alpha$ from $L(c_i)$;
\item We now have $n_j=c_i\in C$ and define $G_0$ as the subgraph with outer face
$C_0=c_i\ldots c_nn_{k-1}\ldots n_{j-1}$ and $G_1$ as the subgraph with outer face $c_0\ldots c_i$. If $c_i=c_1$
we ignore $G_1$;
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $x=y=p$, apply the algorithm first to $(G_0, c_n, c_i, c_n)$ and then to $(G_1, c_i, p, p)$;
\item If $y=p$, $x\ne p$, and $c_i\in C[x,p)$, apply the algorithm first to $(G_1, x, p, p)$ and then
$(G_0, c_i, c_i, c_i)$;
\item If $y=p$, $x\ne p$, and $c_i\in C(y,x)$, apply the algorithm first to $(G_0, x, c_i, x)$ and then to $(G_1, c_i, p, p)$;
\item If $x=p$, $y\ne p$, and $c_i\in C(y,x)$, apply the algorithm first to $(G_0, c_n, c_i, c_n)$ and then to $(G_1, c_i, p, y)$;
\item If $x=p$, $y\ne p$, $c_i\in C(p,y]$, and $\alpha\in L(c_i)$, color $c_i$ with $\alpha$ and apply the
algorithm first to $(G_1, p, c_i, p)$ and then to $(G_0, c_n, y, c_i)$;
\item If $x=p$, $y\ne p$, $c_i\in C(p,y]$, and $\alpha\not\in L(c_i)$, apply the
algorithm first to $(G_1, p, c_i, p)$ and then to $(G_0, c_n, y, c_n)$;
\item If $x\ne p$, $y\ne p$, $c_i\in C[x,p)$, apply the algorithm first to $(G_1, x, p, y)$ and then to
$(G_0, c_i, c_i, c_i)$;
\item If $x\ne p$, $y\ne p$, $c_i\in C(y,x)$, apply the algorithm first to $(G_0, x, c_i, x)$ and then to
$(G_1, c_i, y, p)$;
\item If $x\ne p$, $y\ne p$, $c_i\in C(p,y]$, and $\alpha\in L(c_i)$, color $c_i$ with $\alpha$ and apply the
algorithm first to $(G_0, x, y, c_i)$ and then to $(G_1, p, c_i, p)$;
\item If $x\ne p$, $y\ne p$, $c_i\in C(p,y]$, and $\alpha\not\in L(c_i)$, apply the
algorithm first to $(G_0, x, y, x)$ and then to $(G_1, p, c_i, p)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Implementing the Path 3-Choosing Algorithm}

Let $G$ be a $2$-connected weakly triangulated plane graph represented as an incidence list (or adjacency list)
and an ordering of edges around each vertex following a planar embedding.
We will track subgraphs by marking each vertex with a \emph{state} of \emph{interior},
\emph{face}, or \emph{colored}. Vertices will only change in state from \emph{interior} to \emph{face} to
\emph{colored}. For each \emph{face} and \emph{colored} vertex we will have a \emph{neighbor range}
that tracks the range of edges in its ordered incidence list that belong to the current subgraph. 
Note we may walk clockwise along the outer face from some
\emph{face} vertex $v$ by simply proceeding to the first vertex in its neighbor range.\\

\noindent To be able to perform the procedure from the proof above we must also determine where each \emph{face} vertex
lies on the outer face with respect to $x$, $y$, and $p$. Each vertex will recieve a mark associating it with a
face segment. Each face segment may simply be represented by an integer type. The face segments for $C[x,p)$ and
$C(p,y]$ will need to be joined in the case $\alpha\not\in L(c_i)$
and $c_i\in C(p,y]$ since $p$ will be moved away to start a new path. We use a disjoint set data structure,
as described in [u], to allow efficient union and find operations on face segments.\\

\noindent In step (4) of the path 3-choosing algorithm we perform
the following for each $n_j$ in addition to the regular steps of the algorithm:

\begin{enumerate}
\item if $n_j$ is interior, initialize its \emph{neighbor range} set its \emph{state} to \emph{face};
\item set $n_j$'s \emph{face location} to the current $C[x,p)$ face segment, making a new face segment if none exists;
\item contract the \emph{neighbor range} of $n_j$ to remove $p$ from its incidence list.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Once the above procedure terminates we will have located $c_i$. We have almost determined $G_0$ and $G_1$
by our tracking of \emph{state} and \emph{neighbor range}. It only remains to find
the \emph{neighbor range} for $c_i$ in both $G_0$ and $G_1$. This can be achieved by locating $p$ in
$c_i$'s incidence list and splitting the \emph{neighbor range} of $c_i$ at the $pc_i$ edge. Comparing $c_i$, $x$,
$y$, and $p$, along with the \emph{face location} and \emph{state} properties for each we may determine which case
to apply in step (6). In each recursive call we must also pass any face segments that appear and rename
them accordding to their new positions with respect to the new assignments of $x$, $y$, and $p$.
