\section*{Abstract}

We present an algorithm to path $3$-list-color plane graphs based on the work by Skrekovski [2]
and Hartman [1].

\section*{Introduction}

\noindent All graphs discussed are assumed to be simple, undirected, and plane embeded. For plane embeddings we assume
the edges around each vertex are arranged in clockwise order. For a graph $G$, let $V(G)$ denote its vertex set
and $E(G)$ denote the edge set.\\

\noindent Using notation from [1], for $v\in V(G)$ we will denote the \emph{neighborhood} of $v$ in $G$ as
$N_G(x)=\{u\in V(G)\mid uv\in E(G)\}$. For $u,w\in N_G(v)$ we will use $[u,w]_v$ and $(u,w)_v$ to denote the ordered list of vertices between $u$
and $w$ in $N_G(v)$ in clockwise embedded order, inclusive and exclusive respectively. We will use $[u,w]'_v$ and $(u,w)'_v$ for the
equivalent counterclockwise listings. If $C$ is a cycle, for $u,v\in C$ let $C[u,v]$ and $C(u,v)$ denote the set of
vertices between $u$ and $v$ in clockwise embedded order, inclusive and exclusive respectively. \\

\noindent If $L(v)$ assigns
a list of $k$ colors to each vertex $v\in V(G)$, a \emph{$k$-list-coloring} colors $G$ such
that each $v\in V(G)$ is colored from $L(v)$. A \emph{path $k$-list-coloring} is a $k$-list-coloring such that
each color class induces a disjoint union of paths.

\section*{Vertex Removal}

In this section we present a lemma describing the effects of vertex removal on weakly triangulated plane
graphs. This will be necessary to remove already colored paths from our graph. We consider removing a vertex
from the outer face that has only two neighbors in the outer face (i.e. no chords).\\

\begin{adjustwidth}{2em}{2em}
\noindent \textbf{Lemma 1.} Let $G$ be a weakly triangulated $2$-connected graph with $|V(G)|\ge 4$ and
outer face
$C=c_0c_1\ldots c_{n}$ in clockwise embedded order. Then if $N_C(c_0)=\{c_{1},c_{n}\}$,
$G_0=G-c_0$ is a weakly triangulated graph with $|V(G_0)|\ge 3$ and outer face
$C_0=c_1\ldots c_{n}(c_{1},c_{n})'_{c_0}$.\\
\end{adjustwidth}

\begin{proof}
First notice that $G_0$ is clearly weakly triangulated since $G$ was weakly triangulated and we removed a
vertex from the outer face. Furthermore, $C_0$ is a cycle the path $(c_1,c_n)'_{c_0}$ was disjoint from $C$.
Therefore for each $u,v\in C$ there will be two vertex disjoint $uv$-paths. Since $G_0$
is weakly triangulated, each $v\in G_0-C$ will have at least two vertex disjoint
paths to vertices on the outer face. Thus, $G_0$ is $2$-connected.
\begin{comment}A disjoint $uv$-path will be a $uv$-path
that is vertex disjoint except for the vertices $u$ and $v$.
Let $u,v\in G_0$. If $u,v\in C_0$ then there are clearly two disjoint $uv$-paths. If $u\in C_0$ and
$v\not\in C_0$, there are two edge disjoint paths $v$ to $C_0$, and thus two disjoint $uv$-paths. Finally,
if $u,v\not\in C_0$ then we may find two disjoint paths from $u$ to $C_0$ and two disjoint paths $v$ to $C_0$
and join each pair using the outer cycle.
Clearly in each case we have two edge disjoint $uv$-paths and $G_0$ is $2$-connected.\end{comment}
\end{proof}

\begin{comment}
\noindent Using the previous statement we produce a stronger statement describing the result of removing any outer face
vertex from a weakly triangulated graph. A \emph{block} of a graph $G$ is a maxmimal subgraph $H$ of $G$ such
that $H$ is $2$-connected or a complete graph on $1$ or $2$ vertices.\\

\begin{adjustwidth}{2em}{2em}
\noindent \textbf{Theorem 2.} Let $G$ be a weakly triangulated $2$-connected plane graph with $|V(G)|\ge 3$ and outer face
$C=c_0c_1\ldots c_{n-1}$ in clockwise embedded order. Then $G-c_0$ may be divided up into one or more blocks
$G_0,\ldots,G_k$ such that $G-c_0=G_0\cup G_1\cup\ldots\cup G_k$, each $G_i$ has $|V(G_i)|\ge2$, and each
$G_i$ is weakly triangulated if $|V(G_i)|\ge3$. Furthermore, each $G_i$ has at most two cutvertices.

\begin{proof}
Notice if $|V(G)|=3$, then $G-c_0$ is a complete graph on $2$ vertices. Suppose $|V(G)|\ge4$. If 
$N_C(c_0)=\{c_1,c_n\}$ then Theorem 1 applies. Otherwise, there exists $c_i\in N_C(c_0)$ distinct from $c_1$ and
$c_n$. Let us then recurse on the subgraph bounded by $c_0c_1\ldots c_i$ and the subgraph bounded by
$c_ic_{i+1}\ldots c_nc_0$. Note that after removing $c_0$ each subgraph will only have the
cutvertex $c_i$ in common.

\section*{Path 3-List Coloring Plane Graphs}

In this section we present a correct algorithm for producing path $3$-list coloring of a plane graph. The following
theorem is equivalent to the results produced by Hartman in [1] and independantly by Skrekovski in [3]. The objective in restructuring
the theorem is to empasize the mechanical operations that would take place in an algorithm implementation
to produce such a coloring.\\

\begin{adjustwidth}{2em}{2em}
\noindent\textbf{Theorem 2.} Let $G$ be a weakly triangulated $2$-connected graph with outer face $C=c_0c_1\ldots c_{n}$
and let $x,y\in C$, not necessarily distinct.
Suppose $L(v)$ assigns a list of colors to each $v\in V(G)$ such that
\[
    \begin{array}{ll}
	    |L(v)|\ge 1 & \text{if } v=x \text{ or } v=y;\\
	    |L(v)|\ge 2 & \text{if } v\in C, v\ne x, v\ne y;\\
	    |L(v)|\ge 3 & \text{otherwise.}
    \end{array}
\]
Let $P$ be a (potentially null) induced path in $G$ of vertices in $C[x,y]$. Assume
there exists color $\alpha$ such that for all $v\in P$, $\alpha\in L(v)$ and $v$ has been colored $\alpha$. Also,
for all $u\in C[x,y]-P$, $\alpha\not\in L(u)$. If $x=y=p$, with $p$ the first vertex of $P$,
then $p$ may be colored $\beta\ne\alpha$.\\

\noindent There exists a path list-coloring of $G$ from list assignment $L(v)$ such that $x$ and $y$ have at
most one neighbor of the same color and no neighbors of $P$ recieve color $\alpha$.\\
\end{adjustwidth}

\begin{proof}
We proceed by induction on $|V(G)|$. If $|V(G)|\le3$ the statement is trivial. Let $|V(G)|\ge4$ and suppose the
statement holds for all graphs $G'$ with $|G'|<|G|$. Let $C=xc_1\ldots c_{n}$ be the outer face of $G$.\\

\noindent Suppose $P$ is a null path. We will construct a new induced path $P$ starting with $x$ and
satisfying the parameters of the Theorem statement. Let $\alpha$ be
the first, and possibly only, color in $L(x)$.
Initialize $P$ to be the singleton path $x$. Let $c_i\in C[x,y]$ be the current end of the path $P$.
Let $c_j$ be the closest vertex to $y$ in $N_C(c_i)\cap C(c_i,y]$ such that $\alpha\in L(c_j)$. If such a
$c_j$ exists, append it to $P$ and consider this new end vertex. Otherwise we are done and we color each
vertex in $P$ with $\alpha$.\\

\noindent Suppose there exists a non-null induced path $P$. There are several cases to consider.\\

\noindent Case 1: Suppose $P$ takes a chord $c_ic_j$,
$j>(i+1)$, accross $C$. Then the inductive hypothesis holds for the subgraph $G_0$
bounded by $C[c_i,c_j]$ with $x=c_j$, $y=c_i$, and $P=c_jc_i$. Furthermore, the inductive hypothesis
holds for the subgraph $G_1$ bounded by $C[c_j,c_i]$ with $P'=P$, $x'=x$, $y'=y$. Since $G_0$ and $G_1$
share only vertices in $P$, the coloring of $G=G_0\cup G_1$ will be a path coloring.\\

vertices $v$. After removing $p$, there may be
vertices in $P'=P-p$ and it must be maintained that $P'$ is between $x'$ and $y'$ clockwise on the outer face.
If $x=y=p$ ($x$ and $y$ are removed), set $x'=c_1$ and $y'=c_n$.
If $p=x$, $p\ne y$ ($x$ is removed) we set $x'=c_{n}$, otherwise $x'=x$. Similarly, if $y=p$ set $y'=c_1$,

\noindent If $p\ne x$ and $p\ne y$, then clearly all $n\in N_G(p)$ fit these the above critera. Thus, using Lemma 1 the inductive hypothesis
holds for $G_0=G-p$, $x'$, $y'$, $P'$, and $L'(v)$. If $x=y=p$, we may have $|L'(c_n)|=1$ and
$|L'(c_1)|=1$, but we have $x'=c_1$ and $y'=c_n$ so the hypothesis holds. In the case $x=p$ (or $y=p$), we may have $|L'(c_n)|=1$

\noindent Case 2.2.3: Suppose $c_i\in C(p',y)$. This is similar to Case 2.2.1, but with the added
dificulty that there might be remaining vertices of $P$ in the subgraph not containing $x$ and $y$. First
notice that the inductive
hypothesis holds for the subgraph $G_0$ bounded by $C[c_i,p]$ and the edge $pc_i$, $P'=p$, $x'=x$, $y'=y$.
Now $c_i$ is colored with some color $\beta\ne\alpha$ by the path coloring of $G_0$. Let $G_1$ be the subgraph
bounded by $C[p,c_i]$ and the edge $pc_i$. Then the inductive hypothesis holds for
for $G_1$ with $P'=c_iP$, $x'=c_i$, $y'=c_i$. Since $c_i$ will have no same color neighbors in $G_1$,
the coloring of $G=G_0\cup G_1$ is a path coloring.
\end{proof}

\noindent Since adding edges does not make a graph easier to color, we may add edges to weakly triangulate
any graph. Then we may assign color lists of size $3$ to each vertex, set $x$ and $y$ to be arbitrary
vertices on the outer face, and apply Theorem 2.


\begin{comment}
\begin{proof}
Let $w\in N_C(z)$ be the closest vertex to $y$ between $z$ and $y$ along the outer face, allowing $w=y$.

We will proceed by removing one vertex from $P$ at a time. Let us set $L(v)=L(v)-\alpha$ for
each $v\in N_{G-P}(x)$. Thus for $v\in N_{G-P}$, if $v\in C$ then $|L(v)|\ge1$ and $|L(v)|\ge2$ otherwise.
Let $w$ and $z$ be the vertices immediately prior and immediately following $x$ in $C$ respectively.
By applying Theorem 2 we may remove $x$.\\

\noindent We continue the above process, recursing on all blocks produced, until all path vertices are removed.
Let $G-P=G_0,G_1,\ldots,G_k$ be the blocks produced. We then proceed through each $G_i$ from first split to last
split.\\

\noindent Suppose $y\not\in G_i$. If $G_i\cap P-x\ne\emptyset$ we color $G_i$ with Theorem 3 using the cutvertices
as $x$ and $y$, and $G_i\cap P-x\ne\emptyset$ as the path. Otherwise we color $G_i$ with Theorem 4 using
cutvertices as $x$ and $y$.\\

\noindent Suppose $y\in G_i$. By our construction of Path $P$ we know either $y$ is a cutvertex, or
one cutvertex $c$ has $|L(c)|\ge2$. In this case we color $G_i$ in the manner described above and find
$c$ has been colored some color, we will call $\omega$. Then let us color . In this way we ensure that \\

\noindent Otherewise, by Theorem 2, let $G-p=G_0,G_1,\ldots,G_k$ ordered such that $G_0$ is the block
containing $w$ and proceeding over until $G_k$ is the block containing $z$. Clearly $G_0$ and $G_k$ will
have a single cutvertex and each $G_i$, $0<i<k$, will have two. Furthermore, $c\in G_i$ is a cutvertex
if and only if we had $c\in C\cap N_G(x)$ and therefore the cutvertices, and vertices $w$ and $z$ are exactly
the vertices guaranteed
$|L(v)|\ge1$. All other vertices $v$ on the outer face of each $G_i$ will have $|L(v)|\ge2$ and remaining
interior vertices will still have $|L(v)|\ge3$.\\

\noindent We shall proceed through each $G_i$ from $G_0$ to $G_k$. Suppose $y\not\in G_i$.
If $P-x\cap G_i=\emptyset$ then we may apply Theorem 4 and color $G_i$. Otherwise apply Theorem 3 with graph
$G_i$, path $P-x\cap G_i$, and 


\end{proof}

\begin{adjustwidth}{2em}{2em}
\noindent \textbf{Theorem 4.} Let $G$ be a weakly triangulated plane graph with outer face $C$.
Furthermore, let $x,y\in C$
and $L(v)$ assigns a list of colors to each $v\in V(G)$ such that
\[
    \begin{array}{ll}
	    |L(v)|\ge 1 & \text{if } v=x \text{ or } v=y;\\
	    |L(v)|\ge 2 & \text{if } v\in C, v\ne x \text{ or } y;\\
	    |L(v)|\ge 3 & \text{otherwise.}
    \end{array}
\]
Then $G$ may be colored from the list assignment $L(v)$ such that each color class induces a disjoint
union of paths and $x$ and $y$ each have at most one neighbor of the same color.

\begin{proof}
We proceed by induction on $|V(G)|$. If $|V(G)|\le3$ the statement is trivial. Suppose $|V(G)|\ge4$ and the
statement holds for all graphs $G'$, $|G'|<|G|$. Let $C=xc_1\ldots c_{n}$ be the outer face of $G$.\\

\noindent Let $\alpha$ be the first, and possibly only, color in $L(x)$. For $u,v\in C$, let $C[u,v]$ denote the set of
vertices along the outer face in clockwise order between $x$ and $y$ inclusive. We will construct a
chordless path $P$ of vertices along the outer face in $C[x,y]$,
starting with $x$, such that we may color each vertex in $P$ with the color $\alpha$.\\

\noindent Initialize $P$ to be the singleton path $x$. Let $c_i\in C[x,y]$ be the current end of the path $P$.
Let $c_j$ be the furthest vertex in $C[c_i,y]$ such that $\alpha\in L(c_j)$. If such a $c_j$ exists, append it
to $P$ and recurse. Otherwise we are done.\\

\noindent Suppose $P$ takes a chord $c_ic_j$,
$j>(i+1)$, accross $C$. Then we may apply Theorem 3, with $x=c_i$ and $y=c_j$, to the weakly triangulated graph
bounded by $C[c_i,c_j]$ and the
edge $c_ic_j$. Then we may apply Theorem 3 to the weakly triangulated
graph bounded by $P$ and the remaining $C$, with our current $x$ and $y$.
\end{proof}
\end{adjustwidth}

\noindent Let $G$ be a weakly triangulated graph $G$, $|V(G)|\ge3$, with outer face cycle $C$.
A core step in the Hartman-Skrekovski algorithm requires the removal of a vertex from $C$ and classifying
the remaining graph into pieces meeting the Algorithm conditions.\\

\noindent \textbf{Lemma 1.} Let $G$ be a graph with $|V(G)|\ge 4$. Let the cycle $C=c_0c_1\ldots c_{n-1}$ be
the outer face of $G$ in clockwise embedded ordeer. Suppose $c_i\in C$. If $N_C(c_i))=\{c_{i-1},c_{i+1}\}$,
then $H=G-c_i$ is a weakly triangulated graph with outer face $c_0c_1\ldots c_{i-1} N_G(c_i)$ and $|V(H)|\ge 3$.

\noindent Let $G$ be a weakly triangulated plane graph with a combinatorial embedding.
Suppose $B$ is a block of $G$. Let the cycle
$C$ be a the outer face of $B$ in clockwise ordering. Let $x,y\in C$ be two
not necessarily distinct vertices on the outer face. Finally, for each vertex $v\in B$, let $L(v)$ map to a
list of potential colors such that
\[
\begin{array}{ll}
	|L(v)|\ge 1 & \text{if } v=x \text{ or } v=y;\\
	|L(v)|\ge 2 & \text{if } v\in C, v\ne x \text{ or } y;\\
	|L(v)|\ge 3 & \text{otherwise.}
	\end{array}
\]
The algorithm shall produce a coloring $\lambda(v)$ mapping each vertex $v\in B$ to a single color in $L(v)$
such that the color classes of $\lambda$ induce a disjoint union of paths on $B$ and each of $x$ and $y$
have at most one neighbor of the same color.\\

\noindent Let $\alpha$ be the first, and possibly only, color in $L(x)$. For $u,v\in C$, let $C[u,v]$ denote the set of
vertices along the outer face in clockwise order between $x$ and $y$ inclusive. We will apply
the following algorithm to construct a maximum length path $P$ of vertices along the outer face in $C[x,y]$,
starting with $x$, such that we may color each vertex in $P$ with the color $\alpha$. \\

\noindent\textbf{Find path $P$.}\\
Initialize $P$ to be the singleton path $x$. Let $c_i\in C[x,y]$ be the current end of the path $P$. For each
$n\in N(v)$ in clockwise order, if $n\in C[c_i,y]$ and
$\alpha\in L(n)$ add $n$ to the end of path $P$ and check again with $n$ as the new path end vertex.\\

\noindent Now that we have constructed $P$, let us color $\lambda(v)=\alpha$ for all $v\in P$. It remains to color the
remaining graph $B-P$. We will do this by removing the path $P$ and recursing on the remaining blocks.\\

\noindent\textbf{Deal with lobes.}\\
First let us handle \emph{lobes}, sections of $B$ cut off if $P$ follows chords of $C$. Walking
along the vertices of $P$ if we find a chord edge, $c_ic_j\in P$ with $j\ne i+1$, then let us consider subgraph
bounded by the outer face $C[c_i,c_j]$ and the edge $c_ic_j$. Using the
remove path algorithm described later we will remove the colored edge $c_ic_j$ and color the remaing vertices
contained in this subgraph.\\

\noindent\textbf{Deal with interior.}\\
After handling lobes, we must deal with the interior. If $c_i$ is the end vertex of $P$,
the interior is the subgraph bounded by cycle formed by $P$ and $C[c_{i+1},c_n]$. Just as with lobes,
we handle this by applying the remove path algorithm to remove the colored path $P$ and color the remaining
vertices contained in this subgraph.\\

\noindent\textbf{Remove path and find remaining blocks.}\\

	}
}
\caption{continue\_path\label{CP}}
\end{algorithm}

\noindent We set $P$ to be the single vertex path $x$ and use continue\_path$(P)$ to find the desired path.
Then we color $P$, setting $\lambda(v)=c$ for all $v\in P$.\\
